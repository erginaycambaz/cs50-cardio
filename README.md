# CS50 Cardio - A Simple Cardiovascular Disease Prediction System

## Introduction

CS50 Cardio is a cardiovascular disease prediction system developed by Dilmurod Abdusamadov as part of the CS50 2023 course. This project aims to provide a simple tool for predicting the likelihood of cardiovascular disease based on user input. The system utilizes a random forest classification algorithm and is trained on a dataset obtained from Kaggle. It is important to note that the results provided by CS50 Cardio should not be considered a final diagnosis and should not replace professional medical advice.

## Features and Usage

CS50 Cardio offers a user-friendly web interface where users can input their details and obtain predictions regarding their cardiovascular health. Here's a quick overview of the system's features:

1. **Home**: The home page provides a description of CS50 Cardio and gives users an overview of how to use the system. It also contains a link to a short video that provides a tour of the project.

2. **Predict**: In the predict section, users can enter their personal details such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol level, and other relevant information. After submitting the details, the system processes the input using the trained model and provides a prediction regarding the likelihood of cardiovascular disease.

3. **Results**: Once the prediction is processed, users can view the results on the results page. The results will indicate the predicted likelihood of cardiovascular disease based on the input provided.

4. **History**: CS50 Cardio keeps a record of previous analyses in the history section. Users can access their past predictions and review the details of each analysis.

5. **More**: For users who are interested in learning more about cardiovascular disease, the more section provides additional information and resources. It is always important to consult reliable medical sources and professionals for comprehensive information about any health condition.

## Development Process and Versions

CS50 Cardio has gone through several iterations and updates to improve its functionality and performance. Here is a brief overview of the different versions:

1. **Version 0.1**: Initial version focused on the website's structure and layout.

2. **Version 0.2**: Model development phase where the random forest classification algorithm was implemented using a dataset obtained from Kaggle.

3. **Version 0.3**: Model optimization through standard scaling techniques to enhance accuracy and precision.

4. **Version 0.4**: Model deployment using Flask, a popular web framework for Python.

5. **Version 0.5**: Website design and functionality enhancements to improve the user experience.

6. **Version 0.6**: Code annotation and cleaning for better readability and maintainability.

7. **Version 0.7**: Ongoing version focused on debugging and resolving any issues that may arise.

## Future Features

The development of CS50 Cardio is an ongoing process, and there are plans to introduce additional features and improvements in the future. Some of the planned future features include:

1. **Enhanced Model Accuracy/Precision**: The development team aims to further enhance the accuracy and precision of the prediction model. This may involve incorporating additional data sources, fine-tuning the model parameters, or exploring other machine learning algorithms.

2. **Secure Authentication**: To ensure the privacy and security of user data, future versions of CS50 Cardio may implement secure authentication mechanisms. This would provide users with the assurance that their personal information is handled securely.
